## Installation, Downloading & Updating

### Downloading

You can always find the latest version by visiting the [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/deathwarden.73535/)
page or the [McMarket](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/18495/) page. This plugin works on all Bukkit/Spigot/Paper servers from version 1.13 and above.

### Installing

When it comes to installing the plugin, Simply drop the DeathWarden-[version number].jar into your servers plugin folder and then start your server.
Then you are able to adjust all the plugin messages and config settings to suit your needs!

Notes: If you want players to pay for dying you will also need to install [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) installed as well.

### Updating:

Updating is very easy, all you're needing to do is download the new version of the plugin and replace the old version in your plugins folder.

I have implemented an Auto Config Updater that will automatically update all the files if I have changed them in any way.
